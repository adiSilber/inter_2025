You are a judge evaluating whether a model's response correctly answers a math problem.

Problem: """ {question} """

Ground Truth Answer: """ {correct_answer} """

Model's Response:
"""
{generated_text}
"""

Does the model's response contain the correct answer to the problem? Consider the response correct if it arrives at the ground truth answer, even if there are reasoning errors along the way.

Think through your evaluation, then respond with ONLY "yes" or "no" at the end.
